# OpenAlex ID to OMID mapping

This repository contains the code to generate the mapping between OpenAlex IDs and OMIDs. The mapping is based on the public persistent identifiers that are associated with a given entity in both the data collections: e.g., if a journal article's DOI is registered in both OpenAlex and OpenCitations Meta, then the corresponding OpenAlex ID and OMID get aligned.
This alignment permits to add the corresponding OpenAlex ID for every resource already registered in OpenCitations Meta.
