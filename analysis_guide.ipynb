    "First, we can perform basic counts on the input data and the OC Meta BRs that are mapped to a single OpenAlex BR. To make things easier, we can use some of the functions in `omid_openalex.mapping` and `omid_openalex.utils`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by simply counting the number of BRs in the input OC Meta data: each of these BRs is represented as a row in the CSV files (stored in the ZIP archive `oc_meta.zip`, see the configuration file above), therefore we can simply count the number of rows in the file. We should bear in mind, however, that not all BRs are represented as CSV rows in their own right, even though they are available in the OC Meta collection: this is the case of journal issues and volumes, that despite being first-class entities in OC Meta and represented as such in the triplestore, are not necessarily represented as CSV single rows in the OC Meta dump.[^1] \n",
    "Besides counting the total number of BRs represented as a CSV row (i.e. the number of BRs that are processed in the mapping step), we can gain more specific insights by counting, among these BRs, how many have external PIDs (i.e. any PID that is not OMID) and how many have at least one PID that is also supported by OpenAlex (i.e. one PID among DOI, PMID, PMCID, Wikidata ID and ISSN). It is worth noting that only the OC Meta BRs with at least one OpenAlex-supported PID are potentially mappable to any corresponding BR in OpenAlex. \n",
    " \n",
    "[^1]: In the CSV dump, journal volumes and issues are often represented only as values of the *volume* and *issue* fields, and they are not considered for the mapping process, which only takes into consideration the OMIDs and the external PIDs stored in the *id* field."

    "\n",
    "To try and delve deeper into the causes of the multi-mapping, we can attempt to categorise the involved BRs. This can be done by running the process in `mm_categ.py`. Once we obtain the results of the categorisation, stored in a JSON file, we can load them into two pandas DataFrames for ease of use. The categories labels are explained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Categories for Works: \n",
    "- __*A*__: Multiple OpenAlex Works share the same DOI, PMID or PMCID.\n",
    "- __*B*__: DOI(s) for preprint/postprint/version hosted in repository. Instances of this categories are determined based on the DOI prefix, which is associated with the publisher. For example, the \"10.22541\" prefix is associated with Authorea publishing company, which manages a large preprint server; the \"10.17615\" prefix is associated with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which curates/publishes the articles in the Carolina Digital Repository.\n",
    "- __*C*__: Error in data source or 2 entities linked together by mistake (e.g. duplicated DOI).\n",
    "- __*D*__: Version-marked DOI(s). This category includes preprint versions and detects them by checking for version number (e.g. \"/v1\") in the DOI value.\n",
    "- __*E*__: DOI(s) coming from preprint servers (based on the presence of semantic indicators in the DOI suffix, e.g. \"/arxiv\" or \"zenodo\").\n",
    "- __*F*__: Multiple DOIs all from the same publisher/DOI issuer: errata, letters, editorials, other.\n",
    "- __*non classified*__: Non classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categories for Sources: \n",
    "- __*A*__: Multiple OpenAlex Sources share the same ISSN/ISSN-L. Wikidata IDs are not considered\n",
